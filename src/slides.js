## auto-formatting

![what-is-it](./what-is-it.gif)

- automatically formats code

- (on save, on commit, on linting)

---

## better than lint

- linting: **passive** "go fix this"

- auto-formatting: **active** "I fixed it"

---

# please do this

- it’s easy
- it will make you more effective
- you might even like coding more

---

# why should you believe me?

- i’m pessimistic and grumpy
- i’m using it on all my projects

---


# why it’s good

code reviews
looks like one person wrote it
enables you to think at a higher level
removes worries. fewer choices -> better
refactors that seem intimidating (like adding a parent div to an already deep render() function or changing ()=> to class are really just formatting issues.)

---

a quick note

this is not a new idea.
examples: prettier, elm-format, go format.

---

do it right

the real genius is when it’s strict, enforced, and automatic
strict - don’t allow variation
enforced - it’s not optional
automatic - you don’t have to think about it
